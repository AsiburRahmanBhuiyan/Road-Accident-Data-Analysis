# Project Title: Road Accident Data Analysis

## Project Overview:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze various aspects of road accidents, including their causes, effects on different types of vehicles and roads, accident severity, accident locations, and the influence of time and weather conditions.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Initial data cleaning involved extracting relevant insights such as time, date, and road conditions. This included processing and organizing the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. 

## Excel Functions and Tools Used:
Utilized Excel functions and tools such as Power Query, slicers, pivot tables, and DAX for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Data Visualization:
A dynamic dashboard was created, comprising bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and donut charts to effectively visualize the analyzed data.

## Key Findings:
The analysis revealed that the majority of accidents involved private cars. Most accidents occurred in urban areas during the night, under dry weather conditions, on single-carriageway roads, resulting in minor casualties.
